# üê∫ Masterclass Landing Page - Complete Redesign

## Overview

The masterclass landing page has been completely transformed from a conservative, light-themed sales page into a **bold, futuristic, and immersive experience** inspired by "Women Who Run With Wolves" and the song "Wolves" by Big Sean ft. Post Malone.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Themes

- **Financial Independence** - Building empires on your own terms
- **Authentic Transformation** - Becoming your "other self" (el otro yo)

### Visual Language

- **Typography**: Bold headers, clean mono fonts for UI elements, light serif for body
- **Animations**: Floating particles, pulsing glows, smooth transitions
- **Geometric Elements**: Spheres, grids, angular shapes inspired by the video screenshots

## Brand Positioning Summary

**OLD**: Professional online course about personal branding
**NEW**: Exclusive transformational experience for wild women

This isn't a course. It's a pack. It's a movement. It's an identity.

You're not buying modules. You're claiming your wild nature.
You're not joining a community. You're finding your pack.
You're not learning. You're becoming.

**Target**: Women who:

- Moved abroad independently
- Seek financial freedom
- Refuse to compromise power for comfort
- Want to be seductive without selling their soul
- Feel the wolf stirring inside
- Are ready to lead, not follow

---

## Final Notes

This redesign transforms a standard sales page into an **immersive brand experience**. It's bold, it's different, and it will polarize‚Äîwhich is exactly the point.

The right women will feel an immediate visceral response: "This is for me."

Everyone else will bounce‚Äîand that's perfect. You want true believers, not tire-kickers.

**The pack is waiting. üê∫**
