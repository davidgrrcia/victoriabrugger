# 🎨 Rounded Design Update + Logo

## Overview

The entire masterclass experience has been updated with a **rounded, soft aesthetic** replacing all sharp corners. A typography-based logo for "Victoria Brugger" has been created and added throughout the experience.

---

## ✨ What Changed

### **1. Logo Created** 🎨

**File**: `/src/components/shared/logo.tsx`

Two variants available:

#### **Default Variant**

```
Victoria Brugger
──────────────
```

- "Victoria" in bold white
- "Brugger" in light red (#ef4444)
- Gradient underline (red to transparent)
- Perfect for hero sections

#### **Minimal Variant** (Currently used)

```
VB
```

- Just initials "VB"
- Bold white text
- Compact for fixed UI positions
- Used in top-left corner throughout experience

**Usage:**

```typescript
import { Logo } from "@/components/shared/logo";

<Logo variant="default" />  // Full name
<Logo variant="minimal" />  // Just "VB"
```

---

### **2. Logo Placement** 📍

Logo now appears consistently in **top-left corner** at every stage:

- ✅ Entrance Gate (all questions)
- ✅ Stage 1: Awakening
- ✅ Stage 2: Journey
- ✅ Stage 3: Manifesto
- ✅ Stage 4: Choose Pack
- ✅ Stage 5: Final Choice

**Position**: `fixed top-8 left-8` (always visible)

---

### **3. Rounded Corners Applied** 🔄

Everything sharp is now soft and rounded:

#### **Buttons**

**Before**: Square corners
**After**: `rounded-full` (pill shape)

All CTAs now have:

- Rounded pill shape
- Soft shadows with color glow
- Hover effects with enhanced shadows

Examples:

```tsx
// Primary CTAs
className =
  "... rounded-full shadow-lg shadow-red-600/30 hover:shadow-red-600/50";

// Secondary buttons
className = "... rounded-full border-2 ...";
```

#### **Cards & Containers**

**Before**: `rounded-sm` or sharp
**After**: `rounded-2xl` or `rounded-3xl`

- Question option cards: `rounded-2xl`
- Tier pricing cards: `rounded-3xl`
- Transformation stage cards: `rounded-3xl`
- Manifesto statement cards: `rounded-2xl`
- Final choice cards: `rounded-3xl`

#### **Badges & Labels**

**Before**: Sharp rectangles
**After**: `rounded-full`

- "MOST CHOSEN" badge: `rounded-full`
- Progress bars: `rounded-full`

#### **Decorative Elements**

**Before**: Straight lines
**After**: `rounded-full`

- Divider lines: `h-1` with `rounded-full`
- Left accent bars: `rounded-l-2xl`
- All circular elements: Already `rounded-full`

---

## 🎨 Visual Hierarchy

### **Roundness Levels**

```
rounded-full    → Buttons, badges, progress bars, circles
rounded-3xl     → Large cards (tiers, choices)
rounded-2xl     → Medium cards (questions, manifesto)
rounded-l-2xl   → Accent bars (left side only)
```

**Philosophy**: More important/interactive = more rounded

---

   - Example: "Continue →", "I'm Ready →", "CLAIM SPOT"

---

## 💅 Shadow System

All buttons now have color-matched shadows for depth:

```tsx
// Red buttons
shadow-lg shadow-red-600/30 hover:shadow-red-600/50

// Blue buttons
shadow-lg shadow-blue-600/30 hover:shadow-blue-600/50

// Purple buttons
shadow-lg shadow-purple-500/30 hover:shadow-purple-500/50
```

This creates a **soft glow effect** that matches the brand colors.

```

### **Logo Variants**

Switch between logo styles:

```tsx

```

Or create your own variant in `logo.tsx`
